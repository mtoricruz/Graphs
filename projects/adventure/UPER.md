# U
- Must visit each room at least once + doesn't matter where player ends up

- player.current_room.id / player.current_room.get_exits() / player.travel('n'/'s'/'e'/'w') will be useful

- Complete Traversal = 500 entries and no '?' in adjacency dicts
    - need to write traversal alg that logs paths into traversal_path list as
    player walks
